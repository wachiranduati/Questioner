      <h3>Adventuring in the Kenyan Mara?</h3>
      <p>Today Keekorok attracts package tourists where they serve buffet dinners and nescafe coffee on the outside terrace at tea time. The entire feel is that it is trying to be a luxury lodge, but it hasn't quite moved on with the times.
 It's all out there, you just have to pay attention.The question really is how well do they fair with local tourism? Well they treat me with the kind of service a non local will be given or will it be a recap of their online reviews?</p>
