        <h4>Adventuring in the Kenyan Mara</h4>
        <p>Today Keekorok attracts package tourists where they serve buffet dinners and nescafe coffee on the outside terrace at tea time. The entire feel is that it is trying to be a luxury lodge, but it hasn't quite moved on with the times.

That's not to say we didn't like Keekorok, but I had visions of staying It doesn't really matter where you stay in the Masai Mara because you spend most of your time out on game drives.

We spent early morning sunrises and late evening sunsets out on the African Savanna searching for all the wild game we could find in the heart of Kenya.

We hopped into our safari van and spent hours keeping our eyes peeled for wildlife. It's all out there, you just have to pay attention. These animals are made to blend in with their surroundings and if you blink, you may miss an amazing opportunity. in a tented camp surrounded by wildlife rather than a concrete complex sorely in need of an update. Keekorok isn't hurting for business though, every package tourist from the emerging Asian market seems to book their tours at this hotel., incidunt rerum fuga pariatur dolores culpa soluta odit autem perspiciatis tempore iure saepe officiis! Exercitationem eaque nobis tenetur?</p>
